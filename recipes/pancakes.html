    <h3>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe
        card, this was a family favorite. You're gonna love it!</h3>

    <h5>Ingredients:
        <ol>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ol>
    </h5>

    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and
                pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
                griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</p>
