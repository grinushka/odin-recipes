This is the recipe book and the first HTML based project.

So far so good.

During the past couple of hours I've learned a lot about the command line on Linux and a bunch of information about Git and how to work with it. I guess I'm gaining some more confiidence concerning these computer issues. 

Hope It's the beginning of something big :)
